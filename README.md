This is a simple implementation of user authentication and real-time chat.
It includes 2 parts: chat-backend, chat-frontend

### chat-backend

1. First you need to create .env file, just like .env.sample, you need to set your mysql password there.
2. Then you need to run npm i, to install all dependencies
3. Then run npm run dev, to run the server

### chat-frontend

1. You need to run npm i, to install all dependencies
2. Then run npm start, to run the app

You'll see screen with signin/signup. You need to have at least 2 users to see that chat part. 
Then you can click on one of the users, and if he is signed in, you can start to chat with him.
